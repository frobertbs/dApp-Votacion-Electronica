# OpenVote - A Blockchain Voting Solution

**Note: Currently Under Development**

OpenVote is a secure voting application built on blockchain technology. It includes two HTML pages: one for voters (index.html) and one for admin management (admin.html).

## Requirements:
- Metamask - https://metamask.io/
- Ganache - https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
- Remix Ethereum IDE - https://remix.ethereum.org/

## Usage:
1. Download and create a testnet using Ganache
2. Connect the testnet with MetaMask (https://ibb.co/t342kxW)
3. Compile the solidity program (voting.sol) in Remix Ethereum IDE
4. Deploy the compiled smart contract to your testnet and copy the contract address
5. Run the Python script (serve.py) with the contract address as argument to start serving the web application.

Please note that this is currently under development and may not be ready for use in a production environment. We welcome any feedback and contributions from the community to help improve this project.
